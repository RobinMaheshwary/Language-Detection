# Language Prediction

#### In my 6th semester B.Tech minor project at KIIT University, I focused on data visualization using Plotly and T-SNE, contributing significantly to the project's implementation. The project aimed to detect 17 different languages through diverse deep learning and machine learning methods, including LangDetect, LangId, FastText, Sentence Transformer, CNN, LSTM, and multi-layer perceptron. The ultimate goal was to effectively visualize the language detection outcomes using T-SNE and Plotly.

## Requirements
The project requires the following packages to be installed:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- LangDetect
- LangId
- FastText
- Sentence Transformer
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

To install these packages, you can run the following command:

```bash
> pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn langdetect langid fasttext sentence-transformers tensorflow matplotlib seaborn
```

To run the project, you can follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/RobinMaheshwary/Language-Detection.git
```

- Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
> cd Language-Detection
```

- Install the required packages:

```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- To deploy it:
```bash
> streamlit run main.py
```

The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train and evaluate the models, and display the results.
